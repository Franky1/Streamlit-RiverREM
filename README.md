# Streamlit-RiverREM
Streamlit version of the RiverREM Python package created by Kenneth Larrieu to automatically create river relative elevation model (REM) visualisations.

RiverREM is a Python package created by Kenneth Larrieu to automatically create river relative elevation model (REM) visualisations with just a input digital elevation model (DEM). The idea is to allow users to quickly use and try the package out without any coding experience. "The package uses the OpenStreetMap API to retrieve river centerline geometries over the DEM extent. More functionality is offered by the package not shown here and can be found in the documentation in package's GitHub page.
